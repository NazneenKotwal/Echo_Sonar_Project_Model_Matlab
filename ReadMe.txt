ECE 514 Random Process - Project II 
 
A modern approach to estimating the number of fishes in an area by transmitting sound pulses 
is called the echo sonar technique. 

In this approach the reflected waveforms from a school of fish are modeled as a Gaussian 
random process. This technique is more accurate and inexpensive compared to the traditional 
method of fish capturing in the net and counting them manually. A transmitter on the boat 
transmits a sinusoidal pulse and the receiver measures the count of reflected waveform. 
The number of reflected waveform indicates the number of fishes present in the school of fish.
